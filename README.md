A lightweight and efficient Python script that automatically organizes clutter in your directories. It scans a folder, detects file types, and moves them into categorized subfolders (Images, Documents, Music, etc.) instantly.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Sorting:** Categorizes files into `Images`, `Videos`, `Documents`, `Music`, `Archives`, and `Code`.
- **Safe Handling:** Skips folders and the script file itself to prevent errors.
- **Smart Fallback:** Moves unknown file types to an `Others` folder.
- **User Friendly:** Works on the current directory or any custom path you provide.
